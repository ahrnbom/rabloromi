# Rablorömi for Python

This is a Python implementation of a Hungarian card game called Rablrömi, or rather, my family's variant of it. The game is sometimes known as Robber's Rummy in English.

The idea is to implement it in Python, with a web interface in HTML/JS to allow online play, both in real time and as a correspondance game (although real time, with some kind of VOIP solution like Discord, is probably the most fun).

The web interface will use card designs from [Adrian Kennard](https://www.me.uk/cards/), which are in the public domain. 

More details and instructions are coming soon...
